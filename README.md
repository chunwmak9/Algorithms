# Algorithms
It is algorithmic library containing quick implementation of different algorithms.
The following algorithms will be covered:
1. Bucket Sort
2. Bubble Sort
3. ....
4. Graph Concept
   1. Isomorphism / Isomorphic
   2. Uni-directional vs Bi-directional
   3. Weight
   4. Naming and Symbol
   5. Graph Data Structure
        Eagle List\
        Adjacency Matrix\
        Adjacency List\
        Intersection Graph\
        Dependency Graph\
        Subgraph/Supergraph - Relative Relationship\
        Complement Graph (e.g Edge -> Not Edge (for each Vertex) )\
        Reverse Graph (Transpose) (e.g Reverse direction for directional graph )\
        Line Graph\
        Dual Graph
5. Graph (Depth-First Search)
